	<p>Full disclosure - we don't have a 'set' set list if you catch our drift. We more or less have an extensive library of songs in our bag of tricks that we like to pull out from time to time. The following playlist incorporates a selection of those 'tricks.' If you want to make any requests for songs, head on over to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MadTadders/" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and tell us what's up.</p>
